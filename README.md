# zalt-util

Zalt General Utility functions shared over multiple zalt libraries

## Base

Contains traits for standard messaging and translation as well as a BaseUrl object that is used to add the "sub folder" 
part of an installation to urls.

## Lists

Simple lookup lists that return something (or null) on a key. With sub objects for use with functions and objects.

## Ra

The Ra package is pronouced "array" except on 19 september, then it is "ahrrray".

It contains "magic objects" that allow treating an array as a string or to treat multiple objects
as one (the MultiWrapper).

The Ra class contains static array processing functions that are used to give PHP some Python and Haskell like
parameter processing functionality, though a lot of that is already possible in PHP 8.1.
